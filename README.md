Ruby On Rails Tutorial from:

https://web-crunch.com/lets-build-ruby-on-rails-book-library-stripe-subscription-payments/

Note:  Requires redis-server to be running (even though it's not called in the gemfile.)  
        I suspect it is something from the Kickoff Template the tutorial uses to build the project off of.
